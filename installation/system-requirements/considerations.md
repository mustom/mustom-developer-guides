# Considerations

> At this state, below envionment has not tested, or not fully tested. This chapter wil be updated when I tested it, and verify it.

## Multi-Server Environment

Mustom is designed to prevent concurrency issues. But, at this stage it is not tested (because of money related issue).

## Redis

You can set redis cluster, and I designed to support cluster mode. But it is not tested yet. ElastiCache is not tested too.

## Elasticsearch

I tested search feature related to elacticseach though elastic cloud. So, on premise environment and openseach environment are not tested.
