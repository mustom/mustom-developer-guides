# Tested Environment

Written below is the environment that I tested.



* Server : Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)
* Node.js : 16.14.0
* Nginx : 1.18.0
* MariaDB : Ver 15.1 Distrib 10.6.12-MariaDB, for debian-linux-gnu (x86\_64)
* Redis : 6.0.15
* RabbitMQ : some ...
* Elasticsearch :&#x20;

I think Mustom can run other environment as well. For instance, you can substitute MySql instead of MariaDB. If you test it with other environment, please share your experience. So that, I can update this article.
