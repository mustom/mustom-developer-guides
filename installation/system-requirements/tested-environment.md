# Tested Environment

Written below is the environment that I tested.



* Server : Ubuntu 21.10
* Node.js : 16.14.0
* MariaDB : 10.5.15 for debian-linux-gnu (x86\_64)
* Redis : 6.0.15

I think Mustom can run other environment as well. For instance, you can substitute MySql instead of MariaDB. If you test it with other environment, please share your experience. So that, I can update this article.
