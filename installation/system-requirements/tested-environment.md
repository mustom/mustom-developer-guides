# Tested Environment

Written below is the environment that I tested.



* Server : Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)
* Node.js : 18.17.1
* Nginx : 1.18.0
* MariaDB : 10.6.12
* Redis Stack : 7.2
* RabbitMQ : 3.12.2
* Elasticsearch :&#x20;

I think Mustom can run other environment as well. For instance, you can substitute MySql instead of MariaDB. If you test it with other environment, please share your experience. So that, I can update this article.
