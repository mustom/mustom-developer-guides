# Run Installer

#### 1. The first thing you need to do is run installer. Let's assume that Mustom is copied under 'home' folder. You can type 'npm run installer' commend at home folder.

```
root@localhost:/home/npm run installer
```

#### 2. Open your browser, and then access your domain with HTTP and port 8001. (e.g. http://yourdomain.com:8001)

<mark style="color:red;">Please note that you should enter 'http://' not 'https://', because SSL/TLS is not configured yet.</mark>

#### 3. Enter values and crudentials in fields.

#### 4. It is almost done. Build storefront, and admin panel.

```
home/npm run storebuild

// alternatively you can move to 'storefront' folder, and run 'npm run build'
```

```
root@localhost:/home/npm run adminbuild

// alternatively you can move to 'admin-panel' folder, and run 'npm run build'
```
