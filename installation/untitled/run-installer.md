# Run Installer

&#x20;1\. The first thing you need to do is run installer. Let's assume that Mustom is copied under 'home' folder. You can type 'npm run installer' commend at home folder.

```
root@localhost:/home/npm run installer
```

2\. Open your browser, and then access your domain with HTTP and port 8001. (e.g. http://yourdomain.com:8001)

Please note that you should enter 'http://' not 'https://', because SSL/TLS is not configured yet.

3\. You will see this menu.
